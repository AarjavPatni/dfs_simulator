        // update the field. But when is the chunk stored in a node? When the chunk is replicated.
        // Now when is it replicated? When the replicate command from the replicate module is run.
        // But when is this run? L40 of the commands.rs file. But only replicate holds the state of
        // each chunk, i.e, where it's located. Now one way to solve this by just going through all
        // the nodes and then populating the field. But another way is to somehow return the state
        // that's modified by replicate. One design decision is that replicate only performs the
        // task of replicationâ€“given a set of nodes and replicas, it replicates the chunk across
        // the nodes. But it's not necessary that all the nodes have the chunk, so we can't assume
        // that and run add_chunk once more. We also shouldn't mutate the catalog inside replicate
        // because that breaks the one-function-one-task principle. The solution would be to return
        // the pointer to the nodes containing the chunk as a vector, in a tuple along with the cursor
